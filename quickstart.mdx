## Installation

Install the editor package and its dependencies.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @open-email/editor
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @open-email/editor
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @open-email/editor
```

</CodeGroup>

## Basic Usage

The `EmailEditor` component is the main entry point. It must be wrapped in an `EditorProvider`.

```tsx
import { EmailEditor, EditorProvider } from "@open-email/editor";
import "@open-email/editor/styles.css";

export default function MyEditor() {
  return (
    <EditorProvider>
      <div style={{ height: "100vh", width: "100%" }}>
        <EmailEditor />
      </div>
    </EditorProvider>
  );
}
```
