The `<EditorSidebar />` provides the drag-and-drop interface for adding components to the email, as well as a tree view of the current document structure.

## Features

- **Components Tab**: Browse available components grouped by category (Layout, Content, Utility).
- **Layers Tab**: View and manage the hierarchy of the email document. Reorder elements via drag-and-drop.
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag components from the sidebar onto the canvas to add them.

## Usage

If you are using `<EmailEditor />`, the sidebar is included by default. You can also use it standalone if you are building a custom editor layout.

```tsx
import { EditorSidebar } from "@open-email/editor";

function CustomLayout() {
  return (
    <div className="flex">
      <EditorSidebar />
      {/* ... canvas ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props

<ResponseField name="registry" type="ComponentRegistry">
  The component registry to use. Defaults to the internal `defaultRegistry`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="defaultTab" type="'components' | 'layers'">
  The tab to show initially. Defaults to "components".
</ResponseField>
